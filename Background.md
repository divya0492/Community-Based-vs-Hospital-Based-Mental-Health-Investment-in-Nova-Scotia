## Background
<p align="justify">
Mental health is a fundamental component of overall health and wellbeing, influencing individual quality of life, social participation, and economic productivity. In Nova Scotia, demand for mental health services has risen substantially in recent years due to demographic shifts, increasing social and economic stressors, and the long-term psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These pressures have exposed structural weaknesses within the mental health system, particularly in relation to access and service capacity. Long wait times for assessment and treatment remain a persistent challenge, often leading to symptom escalation, increased reliance on emergency departments, and poorer health outcomes for individuals.

Community-based mental health services are designed to address mental health needs earlier in the care continuum. These services typically include outpatient counseling, early intervention programs, community clinics, and wellness initiatives that promote resilience and coping skills. Research suggests that early and accessible mental health support can reduce the severity of mental illness, lower hospitalization rates, and improve long-term outcomes at the population level. In addition to clinical benefits, community-based care can enhance equity by improving access for underserved populations and reducing barriers related to stigma, geography, and cost. However, the effectiveness of these services depends on sustained funding, adequate workforce availability, and strong coordination across regions and service providers.

Hospital-based mental health care plays a critical role in treating individuals experiencing acute or severe mental health crises. Hospitals provide specialized and intensive services necessary to ensure patient safety and stabilization. Despite their importance, hospital-based services are resource-intensive and costly to operate. Over-reliance on hospitals for mental health care can contribute to emergency department overcrowding, increased healthcare expenditures, and elevated levels of staff burnout. These pressures can further reduce system capacity, exacerbating wait times and limiting the quality of care delivered.

Balancing investment between community-based prevention and hospital-based treatment represents a complex policy challenge for the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness. While increased funding for community-based services may reduce long-term demand for acute care, the benefits of preventive investment often emerge gradually and may not immediately alleviate existing service backlogs. Conversely, expanding hospital-based capacity may provide short-term relief but does little to address underlying drivers of rising mental health demand. Budget constraints, workforce shortages, and regional disparities in access further complicate the decision-making process.

Given the interconnected nature of mental health systems, policy decisions cannot be evaluated in isolation. A systems-thinking approach enables policymakers to examine how funding allocation influences feedback loops among service demand, workforce capacity, wait times, patient outcomes, and public trust. Causal Loop Diagrams provide a useful tool for visualizing these dynamics, highlighting both reinforcing and balancing processes that shape system behavior over time. Understanding these relationships is essential for developing a sustainable mental health strategy that balances immediate service needs with long-term population wellbeing.
